## Task

To create a password generator!
For this project I am creating a password generator so that when a user is prompted with options they can select those criteria to generate a random password.

## Javascript

The following was executed in the Javascript:

- Given the assignment Code I have added a function click button.
- The user will enter criteria and if input is wrong there will be a prompt and error message
- Variables were given as a list if false or no input chosen for lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 
- Variables if option is selected or criteria not met as an option for user
- Variables were given to generate random password
- Code was written to the #password input
- A function was written to generate password
- Then the user is presented with a series of prompts for password criteria funcition: Subprocess.
- Conditionals were created so at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. prompt followed by input.
- User types U L N or S and the number of charcter
- A boolean condition was made so that thhe input is validated and at least one character criteria type should be selected.
- A conditional generate password randomly using a for loop and math floor.
- THEN a generate variable so that the password is either displayed and rendered as a random password.
